For this thermodynamics project, we were tasked with analyzing a thermodynamic device in depth. I chose to analyze a heat exchanger presented in a thermodynamics lab. We were given the following set up:
![System Diagram.]({{ "/assets/images/thermoDiagram.jpeg" | relative_url }})

The components of the system were
    -Hot reservoir
    -Cold reservoir
    -Heat exchanger
    -Outlet 1
    -Outlet 2

My group decided to explore the differences between running the heat exhanger in parallel vs. running the heat exhanger in counterflow.
